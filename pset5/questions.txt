4.  Fgets the numerical value of a char in the file that fp is pointing at, making sure that value is not EOF. If it is a 
    letter (or /n for new lines) it will store the numerical value in the char array word, thus casting it by its ASCII value, 
    at a location in the array equal to the value of index. It ignore numerical characters and words longer than 45 Char. 
    When it reaches the "/n" character it wil update the words counter and create a new line. It will then check for mispellings
    updating the counter for mispesllings if it finds one. It then sets the index to 0 and begins to the process all over again
    until fp == EOF. 
5.  The use of fgetc can esnure alphanumeric chracters do not get passed in. Also going character by character lets you find EOF
6.  This way the argument being passed into check and load is always the values at word and dictionary
